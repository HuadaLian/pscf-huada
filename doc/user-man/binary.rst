Binary Installation
===================

The steps to install a precompiled binary are different for different
operating systems, and somewhat different for different distributions of
linux.  The installer for Mac OS X installs a completely self-contained
package that includes copies of all required external libraries. Instructions
for installing binary .rpm and .deb packages for Redhat and Debian linux
systems instead require the user to install packages containing the FFTW
fast Fourier transform and Lapack linear algebra libraries before installing
PSCF.

Mac OSX
-------

The procedure for installing PSCF on a Mac using a binary installer is
similar to that for installing any application on a Mac:

  * Download the Mac .dmg installer from the PSCF home page. This is a
    file with a name of the form pscf-<version>-Darwin.dmg.

  * Open the .dmg file, and drag and drop the pscf_terminal icon file
    into the Applications folder.

To run the program, then simply double click the pscf_terminal application.
The pscf_terminal application opens a yellow terminal window from which 
you can enter standard unix commands to navigate within the directory 
structure of your Mac, and from which you can invoke the pscf command 
using the same command interface as you would on a linux machine. 

The first time you attempt to run pscf_terminal, Mac OSX security settings
will prevent the application from starting because it is from an "Unknown
Developer".  You will need to add an exception for this software.  The 
following instructions for how to do this are copied from those provided 
by Apple at https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18657?locale=en_US:

1. In the Finder, locate the app you want to open. Don’t use Launchpad to
   do this. Launchpad doesn’t allow you to access the shortcut menu.

2. Press the Control key, then click the app icon, then choose Open from
   the shortcut menu.

3. Click Open.

This procedures saves the pscf_terminal app as an exception to your 
security settings, and will allow you to open it in the future by 
double-clicking on the icon, as for any other registered app.

When the pscf_terminal application opens a yellow terminal window, it
also modifies the unix executable search path used in that window so 
as to allow the pscf command to be found when invoked from that window.
This does not, however, allow pscf to be invoked from another terminal. 
If you install pscf using the .dmg installer file but would also like 
to be able to run it from the command line of a unix terminal that you 
open by other means (e.g., using the Mac Terminal app), follow the 
instructions given in the discussion of :ref:`install-compile-cmake-paths-sub`.

Ubuntu or Debian Linux
----------------------

Ubuntu and Debian distributions of the linux operating system both use
variants of the debian package management system, which uses .deb package
files.  To install from binary on Ubuntu:

  * First use the Ubuntu software center graphical installer or the
    apt-get command line utility to install the following packages:

        - libfftw3-3
        - liblapack3
        - libatlas-base-dev

    To install these packages using apt-get, enter::

        sudo apt-get install libfftw3-3
        sudo apt-get install liblapack3
        sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

  * Download the .deb package from the PSCF home page. This is a file
    with a name of the form pscf-<version>-Linux.deb, where <version>
    denotes a version number string.

  * Install the pscf package by running::

        > sudo dpkg -i pscf-<version>-Linux.deb

  * If the above command fails because of a missing dependence, try
    running::

        > sudo apt-get install pscf-<version>-Linux.deb

    This sometimes allows apt-get to attempt to fetch missing dependencies.

  * Confirm that the pscf executable has been installed in /usr/local/bin/
    by typing::

        > which pscf

    from any directory. The string /usr/local/bin/pscf should be printed
    to the terminal screen.


Fedora / Redhat Linux
---------------------

Redhat distributions of the linux operating system, including Fedora
and CentOS, use package management systems that use .rpm package files.
Instructions are similar to those for Ubuntu/Debian, except for the use
of a different package file format and package manager. In this case:

  * Use the yum command line utility or the Fedora graphical package
    manager to install the following packages from the appropriate
    Fedora repository:

        - fftw
        - lapack

    To install these packages using yum from the command line, enter::

        > sudo yum install lapack
        > sudo yum install fftw

    For Fedora 22 and later, you may use the command "dnf" rather than
    "yum" to use an updated version of the yum package management system.
    The command line syntax is identical except for the replacement of
    the word "yum" by "dnf".

  * Download the pscf-<version>-Linux.rpm package from the PSCF home
    page.

  * To install, enter::

        > sudo rpm -Uvh pscf-<version>-Linux.rpm

  * Confirm that the executable has been installed in /usr/local/bin,
    following the instructions given above for a .deb package.
