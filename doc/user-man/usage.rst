Input Files
===========

A standard SCFT calculation requires two input files:

   * A parameter file
   * An input "omega" file  

The parameter file contains both parameters required to define a physical 
system and instructions to execute a sequence of computations.  The input 
omega file contains an initial guess for the monomer chemical potential 
fields.  The parameter file is read by the main program from standard input. 
The path for the omega file is normally specified in the parameter file.  
The format of the :ref:`param-page` is described in the next page of this 
manual.

Command Line Usage 
==================

The syntax for executing the pscf program is thus::

   pscf < param

Here, "param" is the name of the parameter file. This method of executing
the program will cause log messages that describe the progress of the 
calculation to written to the users screen. To run in the background and 
save these messages to a file, you would instead enter::

   pscf < param > log &


where "log" is a file to which we have redirected messages emitted by the 
program during operation. The "&" at the end of this line indicates that
the program should be run in the background, as is appropriate for a long
computation, so that the user can continue on to other tasks in the same
terminal.

Output Files
============

When PSCF is used to solve SCFT equations, it creates several type of output 
files. Paths to these files are generated by appending standard suffixes to 
the value of a string variable 'output_prefix' that is specified in the 
parameter file. 

Running a solution of the SCF equations for a single set of parameters 
creates the following types of output files:

======= ==================================================
Suffix  Description
======= ==================================================
rho     Monomer concentration fields 
omega   Monomer chemical potential fields 
out     Output summary 
======= ==================================================

These output files may be placed in a common directory by setting 
output_prefix to the name of the desired directory, with a trailing 
directory separator. For example, if output_prefix = 'out/', then 
PSCF will generate output files 'out/rho', 'out/omega', and 'out/out'
in subdirectory 'out/' of the directory from which PSCF was invoked.

The rho and omega output files both describe fields, and use the same 
file format, which is also the required format for an input omega file. 
Each of these field file contains a lists of coefficients of a symmetry
-adapted Fourier expansion of the field.  This file format, and the 
underlying expansion, are described in more detail in the page: 
:ref:`field-page` .
