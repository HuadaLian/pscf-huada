PSCF is distributed with a set of Python modules that can be used to 
simplify common data analysis and job preparation tasks.  All of these 
modules are part of a Python package named pscf. These Python modules 
are located within the source code repository in a subdirectory named 
tools/python/pscf of the git repository directory (e.g., of pscf/git). 

Overview
=========

The most important of these python modules are a set of modules that 
can read and write several of the file formats used by PSCF. Each of 
these modules is a file that contains the definition of a single 
class, in which the name of the class is a a capitalized version of 
the name of the file or module. The names of these main modules and 
the classes they contain are as follows:

  ========== ========= =====================================================
  Module     Class     Description
  ========== ========= =====================================================
  paramfile  ParamFile Reads and stores contents of a parameter file
  fieldfile  FieldFile Reads and stores a symmetry-adapted field file
  outfile    OutFile   Reads and stores a output summary file
  sweep      Sweep     Reads and stores summary files produced by a sweep
  ========== ========= =====================================================

The constructor for each of these classes takes the path to a file or 
(for the Sweep class) of a directory as an argument. The constructor 
for each class immediately reads a specified file or (for the Sweep
class) a set of files, and then constructs a a Python object that then
contains all of the data contain in the that file or set of files. The 
values of each named variable or (for field files) array of values that 
are read from file is stored in a corresponding attribute (member data 
variable) of the associated Python object. If the name of a parameter 
or variable is identified by a label in the file format, then the name 
of the attribute that holds the value of that variable is always the 
same as the label used in the file format.

The the constructors of the ParamFile, OutFile and FieldFile each 
parse a particular file format. Each of these three classes also
has a method (member function) named "write". The write function
writes the current contents of the object to an output file using
the same file format as that read by the constructor, thus creating
a file that can be read by PSCF. 

The constructor and write function for each of these classes thus
provide a basis for modifying files of the associated type. To modify
an existing file, one must use the constructor to read that file and
create an associated object, modify the ojbect by using Python commands 
to assign new values to the attributes that hold the values of one or 
more variables, and then write the modified object to a file. The
write operation could either write to a new file, in order to create
a modified version, or could overwrite the original file.

The FieldFile class provides some specialized functions to carry 
out common manipulations on entire lists of Fourier coefficients.
These include operations that add a new column to an array of 
coefficients, corresponding to a new monomer, and to switch the
values of coefficients associated with two monomers. These sorts
of operations are sometimes needed when manipulating existing 
omega files in order to provide input files suitable for a 
related system, such as modifying a solution obtained previously
for a AB diblock copolymer in order to provide a starting point
for a series of simulations of an ABC triblock copolymer.

The Sweep class is somewhat different than the ParamFile, OutFile,
and FieldFile classes, in that a Sweep reads and stores the 
contents of a sequence of output files, rather than a single file. 
The constructor for the Sweep class reads in all of the numbered 
output summary files that are produced by a PSCF "SWEEP" command 
and stores the contents of these files as a Python list of OutFile 
objects. This provides a convenient basis for analyzing the results 
of a sweep, by looping over output files produced by different 
simulations and outputting values of selected variables (e.g., 
free energies) in a compact form suitable for plotting and/or 
further analysis.

To use any of these modules, one must first open a python 
interpreter, import the relevant class, and then construct an object 
of the desired type by passing the constructor the name of the file 
or directory of interest. This pattern is demonstrated in each of 
the examples given below.

Python Environment
==================

To use the pscf python package, Python obviously must be installed
on your computer. Because Python is also required to install PSCF 
from source, instructions for how to check whether Python is
installed (it usually is) or install it if necessary are given in
the documentation regarding :ref:`install-compile-cmake-sec`.

After PSCF is installed, whether it is installed using a binary 
installer or after compiling from source, copies of all associated 
python modules are placed in a directory::

   $(INSTALL_DIR)/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pscf

where $(INSTALL_DIR) is a place holder for the actual absolute path
to the root of the installation directory tree. This pscf/ subdirectory
must be included in the PYTHONPATH environment variable in order for 
the Python interpreter to find and use these modules. This can be 
accomplished by running script $(INSTALL)/bin/pscf-env, as discussed 
in more detail in the discussion of :ref:`install-compile-cmake-paths-sub`. 

After running the pscf-env script, to confirm that the $PYTHONPATH 
is set up correctly, type::

   > echo $PYTHONPATH

This will cause a string to be printed to the terminal that should
include the absolute path of the relevant directory, either by itself 
or as part of a colon separated list of directories.

ParamFile
==========

In the following example, we use class ParamFile to construct
an object that contains the contents of a single parameter 
input file named 'param' in the current directory, and print 
values of the parameter N_monomer (the number of monomer 
types) and the volume fraction of the first chain species.
To do this, one could type the following::

    > python
    python> from pscf.outfile import ParamFile
    python> param = ParamFile('param')
    python> print out.N_monomer
    python> print out.phi_chain[0]
    python> quit()

It is safe to try running this example on any of the examples 
input files that are provided for PSCF - these commands do not
not modify any input files. If import statement produce an 
error indicating that python interpreter cannot find module 
pscf.outfile, this indicates indicates that the PYTHONPATH 
environment is not yet set correctly.

The first line in the above example opens an interactive python 
interpreter, which is closed by the last line. The second line 
imports the class OutFile from module (or file) outfile of 
package pscf. The third line constructs an object named "out" 
of class OutFile. This object then contains the contents of the
file whose name ("param") is passed as an argument to OutFile
constructor function. In python, like in C++ or Java, a 
constructor function is invoked by using the name of the 
class as a function. The constructor for an OutFile takes a
single file name as an argument. 

After the constructor is called, object "out" contains the 
values of all of the variables stored in the file "param".
This is demonstrated by the 4th and 5th line of the above
example, which simply print the values of two variables,
N_monomer and phi_chain[0], to the terminal. The value of 
any labelled parameter in the original file is stored in 
an attribute (or member variable) whose name is the same 
as the name of the label associated with the parameter in 
the associated file. 

Some parameters, such as phi_chain, are stored in PSCF in 
one-dimensional arrays in which different elements refer 
to e.g., different molecular species. All such array-valued
parameters are stored in the associated python object as 
python lists. Individual elements of a python list can be 
accessed using a subscript notation identical to that used 
to access elements of an arrays in C, using indices that 
are numbered consecutively from 0. This is demonstated 
by the 5th line of the above example, in which we use the 
symbol 'out.phi_chain[0]' to access the value of the volume 
fraction of the first (index 0) polymer species. 

Note: All pscf python modules use the C/Python convention 
in which C array and python list indices are numbered 
consecutively from zero. Because PSCF itself is written in
Fortran, it instead uses the Fortran convention in which 
indices start from 1.  One consequence of this is that, 
for example, data associated with the second of two or more 
monomer types is associated with a list index of 1 in all 
python objects, but is labelled by an integer "2" throughout
the source code of PSCF. This means, for example, that 
values of the block_monomer array in the PSCF input 
parameter file, which uses the Fortran convention to 
assign monomer type label values, uses index values
defined using the fortran convention, in which an index
"2" refers to the second monomer type. Users need to be 
aware of this difference and correct for it as necessary 
when using the python modules.

OutFile 
=======

Output summary files can be parsed, modified and output using a 
syntax essentially identical to that used for parameter files. 
In the following simple example, we read an output summary file 
in the working directory named 'out', and then print out the 
values of f_Helmholtz, the free energy per monomer, and 
mu_chain[0], the chemical potential of the first chain species::

    > python
    python> from pscf.outfile import ParamFile
    python> out = ParamFile('out')
    python> print out.f_Helmholtz
    python> print out.mu_chain[0]
    python> quit()

Because the first part of an output summary file has the same 
syntax as an input parameter file, an output summary file from
one simulation can be used as a starting point for creating a 
parameter file for a related system. This can be done either 
by manually editing and copying the output file, or by using
python to read the file, modify the values of a few parameters
and write the contents of the modified object to a new file.

One advantage of using an output from one simulation to create 
an input for another is that the parameter file section of an 
output file is not exact copy of the parameter file used to 
run the simulation, and may contain final converged values of 
parameters for which initial guesses are provided in the input 
file but then modified by the iteration algorithm. Specifically,
the output file for a simulation that is performed with a 
deformable unit cell will contain the final values of the 
unit cell parameters.

FieldFile
==========

A FieldFile object holds all of the information stored in the
symmetry-adapated field file format. This includes the values of 
the coefficients of all basis functions in the symmetry-adapted
Fourier expansion of the field associated with each monomer 
type. The Field file can be used to read and manipulate either
rho (volume fraction) or omega (chemical potential) files, which
use the same file format.

A Field object is constructed using a syntax similiar to that 
for a ParamFile or OutFile object. To create an object named
"omega" that contains the contents of a field file named "omega", 
one would enter::

    > python
    python> from pscf.fieldfile import FieldFile
    python> omega = FieldFile('omega')

**Attributes**

A symmetry-adapted field file contains a header with labelled
parameters followed by a data section. The value of each of the 
parameters that appears in the header is stored in an attribute 
with a name given by the parameter label in the corresponding
file, as for parameters in a parameter file or an output summary 
file. 

The data section of a field file contains columns of numbers that 
represent coefficients of different basis functions in a symmetry 
adapted Fourier expansion.  The contents of the data section are 
stored in three attributes named "fields", "waves" and "counts", 
as discussed below.

The "fields" attribute is a list of lists of Fourier 
coefficients.  Each element of list fields is a list that 
contains of the Fourier coefficients for one monomer type. 
Thus, for example, if omega is a Field object, omega.fields[0] 
is a list that contains the coefficients given in the first
column of the data section of the associated file, which 
defines the field associated with the first monomer type.
The item fields[1][13] is a real number that is equal to the
coefficient of basis function 13 (the 14th basis function,
with indices numbered from 0) of the field associated with
monomer type number 1 (i.e., the 2nd monomer type).

The "waves" attribute of a Field object is a list in which each 
element contains a list of 1, 2, or 3 integer Miller indices for 
a wavevector characteristic of the associated basis function. The 
number of indices is equal to the dimension of space (i.e., the 
number of directions in which the structure is periodic). These 
indices identify one of the wavevectors that is used to construct 
the the basis function, and acts as an identifier for the basis 
function.  Thus, for example, for the gyroid phase, the second 
basis function, with index 1, is associated with the {211} family 
of plane waves.  In this case, the value of waves[1] is a list of 
3 integers, waves[1] == [2, 1, 1], that identifies the basis 
function constructed from this family (or "star") of wavevectors.

The attribute "counts" contains the integers given in the
last column of the data section of a field file. Each of these
integers gives the number of wavevectors in a "star" of symmetry
related wavevectors that is associated with the corresponding 
basis function. Thus for example, in a file for a gyroid phase,
with space group "I a -3 d", for which waves[1] = [2, 1, 1],
count[1] == 24, because there are 24 wavevectors in the {211}
family of wavevectors of a cubic crystal. 

In the following example, we open and read a chemical potential 
field file named 'omega' in the current directory, print the 
list of Miller indices that identifies basis function number 1 
(the second basis function), and print the value of the coefficient
of this basis function in the expansion of the chemical potential
field for monomer type number 0::

    > python
    python> from pscf.fieldfile import FieldFile
    python> omega = FieldFile('omega')
    python> print omega.waves[1]
    python> print omega.fields[0][1]


Sweep
======

The Sweep class is a container that holds all of the data given
in the set of number output summary files produced by a PSCF 
SWEEP command.  

The SWEEP command performs a sequence of SCFT calculations along 
a line in parameter space. This command produces a set of output 
files for each of the resulting points in parameter space, with 
file names that begin with an integer index. The resulting output 
summary files have names of the form <output_prefix>i.out, where 
<output_prefix> denotes the output_prefix string parameter given 
in the input parameter file, and where i is an integer index. The 
index i has values in the range [0, s_max], where s_max is the 
maximum value given in the parameter file.  Typically, the string
output_prefix is taken to be the name of a directory including a 
trailing backslash (/) directory separator, such as "out/".  In 
this case, the SWEEP produces a series of output summary files 
in the specified directory with names 0.out, 1.out, 2.out, etc.

The constructor for a Sweep object assumes that the SWEEP
command was run using a directory name with a trailing slash
as an output_prefix, and that the output directory thus 
contains a sequence of files with names 0.out, 1.out etc.
The constructor takes the name of the directory (with no
trailing slash) as an argument, and reads any such sequence 
of such numbered output summary files that it finds in that
directory. If it finds such a sequence of files, it creates
a python list of OutFile objects, each of which contains the 
contents of a single corresponding output summary file. Each 
of the resulting Outfile objects can be accessed by applying 
the subscript [] operator directly to the Sweep object, thus 
emulating the syntax of a Python list. Thus, if x is a Sweep 
object, x[8] is an OutFile object containing the contents of 
the file named 8.out in the directory that was named in the 
Sweep constructor. The number of OutFile objects in Sweep 
object named x is returned by the operator len(x), as for 
a list.

The following example illustrates the syntax for creating
a Sweep object and printing the value of a particular 
variable in a particular simulation::

    > python
    python> from pscf.sweep import Sweep
    python> x = Sweep('.')
    python> print len(x)
    python> print x[8].f_Helmholtz

In this example, we assume that the python interpreter 
was run from the directory containing a set of output 
summary files named 0.out, 1.out etc. The third line of 
this example thus reads all of the output files in the 
working directory. This is indicated here by the unix 
shorthand '.' for the current directory, which is passed 
as an argument to the Sweep constructor. The fourth line 
prints the number of output summary files found in that
directory.  The fifth line prints the value of the 
variable f_Helmholtz read from the file 8.out.

Users can aalso iterate over the list of OutFile objects 
contained in a Sweep object in order to output or 
manipulate lists showing how selected variables change
within the sequence of calculations. This is shown in the 
following example::

    > python
    python> from pscf.sweep import Sweep
    python> x = Sweep('.')
    python> print len(x)
    python> file = open('free_energy','w')
    python> for outfile in x:
        ***     line = str(outfile.block_length[0][1]) + '  '
        ***     line += str(outfile.f_Helmholtz) 
        ***     print line
        ***     file.write(line + "\n")
    python>
    python> file.close()

The fifth line of this example uses the Python open()
function to open a new file named 'free_energy' for writing 
(mode = 'w'). The for loop produces a sequence of text 
lines containing two columns of numbers, in which the first
column contains values of the length block_length[0][1] 
of the second (index 1) block of the first (index 0) 
chain species, while the second column contains the 
value of f_Helmholtz, which is the Helmholtz free energy 
per monomer normalized by kT, and each line contains values
from a different output summary file. In this example, each 
line of this output is both printed to the screen and written 
to a file named free_energy. The penultimate line closes the
file before closing the python interpreter.

The type of operation given above, which produces 
a string of containing two columns of numbers, is
commonly needed to summarize information about a
sweep.  The Sweep class thus provides a method named 
write() that is designed to simplify this operation.
The write function takes two arguments, named expr1 
and expr2, each of which is literal string containing 
a mathematical expression written using the names of 
attributes as variable names. It returns a string 
containing two columns of numbers, in which each 
value in the first column is obtaining by evaluating
expression expr1 and each value is obtained by 
evaluating expr2, and in which each row represents
a pair of values obtained from a different simulation.
The above example could also be expressed using the 
write method as::

    > python
    python> from pscf.sweep import Sweep
    python> sweep = Sweep('.')
    python> text = sweep.write('block_length[0][1]','f_Helmholtz')
    python> print text
    python> file = open('free_energy','w')
    python> file.write(text)
    python> file.close()
    python> quit()

Each of the arguments of the write functions are text strings
that are interpreted as mathematical expressions in which the
names of parameters or elements within array-valued parameters
are used as variable names. In the simple example given above, 
these strings were simply the names of individual variables 
or array elements. One can, however, instead pass this function
string representations of less trivial mathematical expressions.
For example, the satement

    text = sweep.write('2.0*block_length[0][1]', 'f_Helmholtz - f_homo')

would produce a string containing the contents of a two-column
data file in which each value in the first column is twice the
length of the 2nd block of the first chain species, and in which
each value in the second column is the difference between the
free energy per monomer in the converged structure and that of
a hypothetical homogeneous mixture of the same set of molecules
with the same overall composition.
