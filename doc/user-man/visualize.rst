Matlab Visualization Tool
**************************

PSCF is distributed with a matlab script that makes it easy to visualize 
the mononmer concentration profiles produced by solving the self-consistent 
field equations. This script was written and contributed to the project by 
Naveen Pillai while he was an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. 
Documentation for the visualization script, with complete usage instructions, 
is given in the file::

    doc/tools/PSCF_Visualization.pdf

within the git repository directory (e.g., within pscf/git). The matlab
file itself is located at::

    tools/matlab/polymer_visual.m
  
within the git repository tree.
