General: Python modules should be separated from executable scripts, 
rather than having both in a single file, since they should be installed 
in different locations.

Notes on where components should be installed as if installed in site
directories (rather than user) directories:

MAC OSX
-------

Python modules: /Library/python/2.7/site-packages/pscf

       (Note change scripts to use 2.7, rather than 2.4)

Double clickable executable: Can be installed in Applications

Command line executable: Symlink from /usr/local/bin to executable
in Applications.

Matlab:           ????????
Linux
-----

Executables:      /usr/local/bin

Python modules:   /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pscf/

Matlab:           ????????
