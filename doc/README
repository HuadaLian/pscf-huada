Re-Generating Developer API Documentation
-----------------------------------------

If you modify the source files, you may wish to regenerate the html 
api documentation. This documentation is extracted from the Fortran 
source files by the GDoc.py python script, which is distributed as
part of this package.  To generate html api documentation:

 - From within the pscf/doc directory, enter::

      > make devel-man

 - At the prompt "Enter name of rc configuration file:", enter::

      devel-man.rc

   The resulting documentation will be created in subdirectory 
   doc/devel-man, which will be created if it does not already exist. 

 - To remove old html documentation and start over, enter::

      > make clean

   This will remove the entire doc/devel-man subdirectory.

Re-Generating the User Manual
-----------------------------

   To generate a local copy of the user manual, enter::

      > make user-man
