To Install: 
===========
Drag and Drop "pscf_terminal.app" to your Applications Folder.

To Run:
=======
Double click the "pscf_terminal.app"

First Time Users: 
=================
The first time you attempt to run pscf_terminal, Mac OSX security settings will
prevent the application from starting because it is from an "Unknown
Developer". You will need to add an exception for this software. The following
instructions are provided by Apple on
https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18657?locale=en_US: 

1. In the Finder, locate the app you want to open.
    - Don’t use Launchpad to do this. Launchpad doesn’t allow you to access the
      shortcut menu.

2. Press the Control key, then click the app icon, then choose Open from the
   shortcut menu.

3. Click Open.

The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it
in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.


Install the Command Line Tools
===============================
Users who wish to run `pscf` from any Terminal (i.e., outside of the
pscf_terminal.app) can append the following snippet to their $HOME/.bashrc:

#### Enable PSCF CLI #####
source /Applications/pscf_terminal.app/Contents/Resources/bin/pscf-env
#### END ####

New Terminal windows will then have the right environment to run `pscf` and 
the python helper applications. Confirm the CLI functions properly by running
"which pscf" in a fresh terminal. This should return:

/Applications/pscf_terminal.app/Contents/Resources/pscf.app/Contents/MacOS/pscf
